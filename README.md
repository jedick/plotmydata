# Plot My Data - using R with AI Agents

The R software environment is an open-source platform for statistics, data analysis and visualization.
To help R users solve real-world problems, AI agents need access to tools and guidance about their usage.

The aim of this project is to build an intuitive conversational interface to powerful plotting functions.
To do this, we are engineering an ecosystem of AI agents and tools that can run R code and make plots.

A test-driven approach to AI development using known-good traces as evaluation baselines ensures that the system works as expected.
It's made with industry-standard components, supporting different models and scalable deployment options.

## Features

- Instant visualization: Plots are shown in the chat interface and downloadable as conversation artifacts.
- Interactive analysis: Use an R session so variables persist across tool calls.

## Running the project

There are three modes of running the project with increasing degrees of containerization.
The first two modes require local installation of the Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

<details open>
<summary><strong>Containerless</strong></summary>

Start the ADK web server with stdio transport to the mcptools MCP server (requires a local installation of R):

```sh
unset MCPGATEWAY_ENDPOINT
export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key adk web --reload_agents
```

`run.sh` is a shortcut to these commands, taking the API key from `secret.openai-api-key`.
This script also starts an R session that can be used to persist variables across tools calls.

<details>
<summary><strong>Containerized MCP server</strong></summary>

Start the ADK web server with SSE transport to Docker's MCP Gateway:

This requires the plotmydata-tools and docker/mcp-gateway images (see below):

```sh
docker mcp gateway run --catalog=./catalog.yaml --servers=r-mcp --transport=sse --port=8811
```

In a different terminal:

```sh
export MCPGATEWAY_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8811
export OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key adk web --reload_agents
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Full containerization</strong></summary>

First, build the project.
This creates a compose **project** (plotmydata) and three **images** (plotmydata-tools, plotmydata-agent, docker/mcp-gateway):

```sh
docker compose build
```

Next, put your OpenAI API key (`sk-proj-...`) in `secret.openai-api-key`.
Then run the project:

```sh
docker compose up
```

Press `w` to start watching file changes.
Alternatively, use this command so changes to the R and Python code on the host computer are reflected in the running project.

```sh
docker compose watch
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Changing the model</strong></summary>

The remote LLM is gpt-4o-mini.
If you want to use a different one, change it in `entrypoint.sh`.

To use a local LLM running on your GPU, install [Docker Model Runner] before running this command.

```sh
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f model-runner.yaml up
```

The local LLM is [Gemma 3]; this can be changed in `model-runner.yaml`.

Note: This dataset is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository]. The Zenodo URL is used to download a CSV version.

<summary><strong>Persist variables:</strong> <i>Use a session</i></summary>

The full prompt history:
- Use a session
- Save 100 random numbers from a normal distribution in x
- Run y = x^2
- Plot a histogram of y

## Under the hood

Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows AI agents to interact with external tools in a client-server setup.
We use Docker MCP Gateway to connect an [Agent Development Kit] client to an MCP server from the [mcptools] package running in an [R environment].
[Docker Compose] supports definitions of containerized AI agents and one or more MCP servers for scalable and secure deployment.

- The `plotmydata-tools` image is based on [rocker/v-ver]
  - `server.R` defines tools to run R code and make plots
- The `plotmydata-agent` image is based on [Docker Python slim]
  - `PlotMyData/agent.py` defines an **McpToolset** that is passed to the LLM along with instructions for using the tools
  - `PlotMyData/__init__.py` has code to reduce log verbosity and is modified from [docker/compose-for-agents]
- The [Docker MCP Gateway] routes requests to MCP servers (just one in our case)
  - A custom `catalog.yaml` makes our R MCP server visible to the MCP Gateway
  - For more options, see [MCP Gateway docs] and [Docker MCP Catalog] for the default `catalog.yaml`
- Specific actions are used for [Docker Watch]
  - `action: rebuild` is used for `server.R` because we need to restart the MCP server if the R code changes
  - `action: sync` is used for `PlotMyData` because the ADK web server supports hot reloading with the
    [`--reload_agents`](https://github.com/google/adk-python/commit/e545e5a570c1331d2ed8fda31c7244b5e0f71584) flag
